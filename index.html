      <h3>Where we left off</h3>
      <p>Final project has been decided to be a UV reapplication app. We were unsure what tech stack we'd like to use.
         Additionally, there was confusion on what features we want in the app.
      </p>
  
      <h3>New questions</h3>
      <p>
        Do we want to pair program  or work individually?
        Should we get customer feedback as we go through this design process? - If yes then how?
      </p>
  
      <h3>Extra</h3>
      <p>
        There is a prefrence to not work on weekends
